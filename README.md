## Notes:
- Xcode Version: 8.3.3 | Latest iOS 10.3
- Using Xcode's simulator will be a bit laggy. Use Device for best experience.
- Todo list is the feature which I'm working now OR about to start it.
- <b>*Best experience with iPhone 7 Plus. </b>

## TODO list:

- [✔️] "Fix" and find a better logic for the top bar which displays account progress
- [] Re-implement logic to increase enemies' HP and Velocity over time 
- [✔️] Add customized font ttf for Gold Label with OpenGL shader

[*] = Working [✔️] = Done

## Future Implementations:
# One step before going to TODO List (Order does not matter):

# High Priority (Order does not matter):
- [] Add Power-Ups
  - [] Imune Item
  - [] Increase Fire Power
  - [] Double Shoot
- [] Add new bullets for characters:
   - [] Add Alpha Bullet Sprites
   - [] Add Beta Bullet Sprites
   - [] Add Celta Bullet Sprites
   - [] Add Delta Bullet Sprites
   - [] Add Class to create custom bullet sprite
# Low Priority (Order does not matter):
- [] Add new regular monsters
- [] Add Purchase Function
- [] Add Upgrade Bullet Function
- [] Display current level of bullet and its image on Character Scene
- [] Add Companions System (Each side with a small minion to assist you) - Sidekicks!
- [] Add better effect for character's death
- [] Add sound when Fireball is incoming
- [] Pinky constant speed
- [] Add Game Over Scene
- [] Add Unit Test

Note: Each new feature moves from Low Priority -> High Priority -> Todo List. In short, low priority items will go up.

## Discovered Bugs:
- It looks like that for smaller devices such as iPhone 5, the monsters are dying quickly.
- Characters are too big in smaller devices. This is known issue due for using "fixed" size. It will be fixed later on.
- Pinky completly freeze itself when it kills the player

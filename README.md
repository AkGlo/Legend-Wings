## Notes:
- Using Xcode's simulator will be a bit laggy. Use Device for best experience.
- I have only iPhone 7 Plus, so I do not know how well it works for other devices. But It should be okay.
- Currently working on "Pinky" boss. Yea, it takes time to get the sprites done.
  
## New TODO list:
- [] Add Pinky Boss in-game
  - [✔️] Add Pinky Boss Sprites
  - [] Add Pinky Boss Actions
- [] Add Labels in Character Selection
- [] Add particle effects when selecting character
- [] "Fix" and find a better logic for the top bar which displays account progress
- [] Re-implement logic to increase enemies' HP and Velocity over time. 
- [] Add Power-Ups
  - [] Imune Item
  - [] Increare Fire Power
  - [] Double Shoot
- [] Add Companions System (Each side has a small minion to assist you) - Sidekicks!
- [] Add Unit Test

## Known Bugs:
- The top bar is not a bug. I'm just thinking a good approach for displaying them
- It looks like that for smaller devices such as iPhone 5, the monsters are dying quickly.
- HUD displays are not "pretty". I think it's a bit challenging for creating a HUD from sknodes. Thus, in near future, I will replace them with custom OTF/TTF files. I'm still looking for a good software to generate them.
